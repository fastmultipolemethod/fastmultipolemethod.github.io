title: Fast Multipole Method
---

  <h1> Welcome </h1> 

  <p> This website is developed by a group of people working on integral
    equations (IEs) and fast algorithms such as the fast multipole methods (FMM) 
    for large scale simulations. It provides a collection of <a href="/tutorial"> tutorials </a>
    developed by us or our colleagues on these topics, a wide selection of
    open-source <a href="/package"> implementations </a> of the multipole methods on
    shared and distributed memory architectures, and links to many research
    papers, categorized by individual application fields. </p>

  <p> We hope you find this website informative and useful and welcome you to join
    our effort. </p>
